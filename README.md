## Welcome to diveinto.ml

I will make notes about my journey into ML world.

### Short term goals
1. Get [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://youtu.be/Ia-UEYYR44s) till end of May
2. I will start writing here :) 

### My setup and environment
Hardware: HP Zbook G3 + 2x24" monitors AOC 
OS: CentOS 8 ( RHEL based linux distro it was reason why I chose this one)
Python env: [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)
IDE: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
IDE second choise: [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) + VIM

My first corporate experience was gained in the Java world. It was a time where I loved Jetbrains products. But right now trying to find free alternative and I decided to focus use VSC as my main IDE because it's free and have a lot of extensions and support a lot of different languages and technologies.
